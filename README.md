# Kepler3D
a constraint-based 3D physics engine

Quaternions and matrices:

I could have used nalbgebra for matrices and quaternions, but decided to implement themselves, because this is supposed to be an educational project.
Perhaps I will change that in a later version.

Done:
- Basic data structures and logic
- Methods to compute movement

Todo:
- Constraints
- Graphics
- and much more
